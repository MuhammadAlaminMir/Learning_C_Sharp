//  Definition:
//  C# or CSharp is a modern, object-oriented, type-safe, and general purpose programming
//  Language, Developed by Microsoft as part of .Net initiative in year 2000. It was created 
    by Anders Hejlsberg (the creator of Turbo Pascal) and is designed to be simple, powerful
    and versatile for building a wide range of applications.


//  Key Features of C# 
    
    1. Object-Oriented (OOP):
        - Supports Classes, Inheritance, Abstractions, Polymorphism and Encapsulation
        - Everything in C# is an Object (except primitives like, int, float, etc, which are Structs )

    2. Statically Typed: 
        -Variable must have defined type at compile time (e.g., int x = 10;)
        - it Helps catch error early.

    3. Cross-Platform: 
        -Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOs via .Net Core / .Net 5+

    4. Memory Management:
        -Uses Garbage Collection to automatically free used memory.

    5.Rich Standard Library:
        -comes with the .Net Framework / .Net Core, which are now just .NET, providing built in support for:
        - File I/O
        - Networking
        - Databases  (Entity Framework)
        - Web Development (ASP .Net)
        - Game Development (Unity)

    6. Modern Language Features:
        - LinQ (Language Integrated Query) for data Manipulation.
        - Async /Await for asynchronous programming.
        - Pattern Matching, REcords, and more (in new C# 8/9/10)
 
    7. Multi-Paradigm Language,
        - Which means that it supports multiple programming paradigms, like:
            -Object-Oriented Programming
            -Functional Programming
            -Imperative Programming

-- There are Total 13 Versions of C# released till now. and Most of the time a new version came up with its Compiler or integrated environment .Net.
 

** C# requires .NET (or a compatible runtime) to execute.
*.NET is a runtime (execution environment) and framework that provides libraries and tools for running C# (and other languages like F#, VB.NET).
